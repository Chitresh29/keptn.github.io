:bulb: *A quality gate answers one question: Can I deliver my project to production today or not?* 

Please see [here](../../../concepts/quality_gates) to read more about the concept. In this section, you will get an overview of the use-case and learn how to get started setting up a quality gate for your project assuming you are [authenticated](../../operate/install/#authenticate-keptn-cli) for a Keptn installation and have a deployed application.

## Definition of Keptn entities

You have an application that is running in an environment and composed of one or multiple services (aka. microservices). For example, you have an application called `easyBooking`, which can be broken down into the `booking` and `payment` service. The application is running in a `quality_assurance` environment (aka. stage). Below you will learn how to set up a quality gate for multiple stages. 

Given the `easyBooking` application, the Keptn entities of a project, stage, and service map to the example as follows:

* `project`: *easyBooking*
* `stage`: *quality_assurance*
* `service`: *booking* & *payment* (For the sake of simplicity, we want to configure just a quality gate for `booking`.)

Before heading on, it is required to bring in the specification of the [Shipyard](../../continuous_delivery/multi_stage/#declare-shipyard-before-creating-a-project) that declares the environment of the project and the processes a service has to go through. Due to the fact that a quality gate should be configured for the *quality_assurance* environment only, the Shipyard for the *easyBooking* project looks as follows:

```yaml
stages:
  - name: "quality_assurance"
```

## Create project and service

* To create the Keptn project `easyBooking`, use the [keptn create project](../../reference/cli/commands/keptn_create_project/) command.

* To create the Keptn service `booking`, use the [keptn create service](../../reference/cli/commands/keptn_create_service/) command.

**Note:** It is not needed to create the stage, since it is declared in the Shipyard that is applied during the project creation. 

## Configure Keptn to use your SLI-provider

Depending on the monitoring solution you have in place, a corresponding SLI-provider needs to be running inside Keptn. This SLI-provider will get its queries for the individual metrics from the [Service-Level Indicator (SLI)](../sli/#service-level-indicator) config. 

* Familiarize with the concept of an [SLI](../sli/#service-level-indicator) and derive the set of indicators required for the `bookingÂ´ service. 

* Follow the steps of deploying an SLI-provider and uploading an SLI config as described [here](../sli-provider/).

## Activate quality gate

Activating a quality gate means that you add an [Service-Level Objective (SLO)](../slo/#service-level-objective) config to your service; to the `booking` service according to the above example. 

* To add an SLO to the `booking` service, use the [keptn add-resource](../../reference/cli/commands/keptn_add-resource/) command.

## Trigger the quality gate

At this point, you have:

* :heavy_check_mark: created the project `easyBooking` and the service `booking`
* :heavy_check_mark: configured Keptn to use your SLI-provider with custom SLIs
* :heavy_check_mark: activated the quality gate for `booking` by providing an SLO

To trigger a quality gate evaluation, execute the [keptn send event start-evaluation](../../reference/cli/commands/keptn_send_event_start-evaluation/) command. This command sends an event to Keptn, which acknowledges receipt of the event by returning a unique ID (`keptn-context`). This unique ID can then be used to fetch the result of the quality gate evaluation.
